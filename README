This project is a Hello World in Python for me.

I come across this interesting story and all the questions in it some many years ago. A friend of mine asked me these questions and I thought that this will bring me up to speed with Python's internals.

Light questions with a deep understanding of who you are, right now. Everything can still change, nothing is permanent except explicitly said so.

Enjoy this little Hello World with a twist.
